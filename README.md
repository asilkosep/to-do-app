# to-do-app

As an assignment for the Bloc Apprenticeship, I built out a quick interface for a To Do App.

This process involved:
1. HTML & CSS Styling
2. DOM Scripting - Events

I was tasked with adding components like a delete button, with the functionality to delete to-dos in the list. 
MDL was used to structure the appearance of the app.

Please see image of the app, below:
